**Welcome to the Capstone Project Repo**

I am using venv to manage my enviroment and using WSL: Ubuntu on VSCode

**I suggest setting up a venv to keep things working well:**
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

*Also if you need to install more requirements*
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Make Sure to add packages/Imports to requirements!**

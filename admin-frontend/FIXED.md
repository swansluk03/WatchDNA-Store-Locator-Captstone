# âœ… Import Error FIXED!

The "LoginCredentials export" error has been fixed.

## What I Did
Moved all TypeScript type definitions inline in each component file instead of importing from a separate types file. This fixes Vite's module resolution issue.

## To Test Now

1. **Refresh your browser** with a hard refresh:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

2. The login page should now load properly!

3. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

## If It Still Shows Error

Close the browser tab completely and reopen: `http://localhost:5173`

The fix is complete! ðŸŽ‰
